I don't even really know if I fit into your forum, because I'm a loner, my conversation partners are almost exclusively the books. I would have liked to have heard a Tolstoy or Laxness at a reading, unfortunately for me, if it still exists, I cannot be reached. I don't know much about computers, they are only devices that I can use for writing, listening to music or reading reports, they are useful and necessary to me. I often read 6-10 books at once, I work at night, I hardly have any contact with other people, I didn't even have a cell phone until recently ... I tell you all this about the image of an absolutely uninteresting person to make clear. I often don't talk to anyone for weeks, even if only to have fun. My friends are either insane or very old. From some I learn what is still going on in reality, from others what diseases they are currently causing. Unfortunately, I am hypersensitive. Sometimes when I go into business I follow the poor, the faces of which are marked by hard work and I speak to you in silence, I share your loneliness with you ... I never get close to them ... out of fear or shame, me Do not know. Last winter, at the entrance to an abandoned shop, I saw a man who had set up a place to sleep there. It was cold outside, it was snowing and he stood there alone, wrapped in several rags, while people walked past him, deep in their own worry. When it got dark, I went back with a blanket and something to eat. I was afraid to bring him into my house because I'm afraid of everyone. I'm sure he was also afraid of people just like me, I saw this fear in his eyes and I recognized myself. My soul cried for him, my mind was ashamed of people, I was clumsy just like him, that's why I left quickly. At home I cried, not to be for him, but for someone. As a child, when I was allowed to accompany my father around town, he always prepared a Monede for me. It was for a beggar who stood in a corner of our street every day to earn some money. He only had one foot, but he supported it on the bridle where he had some protection from wind and rain. Shortly afterwards I learned myself how to live a person without protection. But I also knew that people shouldn't complain about suffering. It is part of being human. Sooner or later everyone learns this suffering. Today I am not worried about my own suffering, but the suffering of people who are looking for a refuge for the cold winter night ... I do not know whether they will still accept me in their forum after this confessional abuse, but I will certainly not suffer for that as because of the suffering of the street betller or the suffering of the lonely homeless man.
